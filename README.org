* Instructions, part 1

- When run, the program(s) for each question should print out a line
  explaining what it's testing, call the required functions, and print
  the output. There should be no keyboard input unless the question
  explicitly asks for it.
- Place any notes you want to tell me in this file under the *Notes:*
  heading above.
- You are to complete all questions.
- The only sites you may use for reference are our text book
  (https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)
  and the online python3
  documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/. You may not look at
  your own prior work on repl.it or anywhere else.
- Your may not use Python functions or methods that defeat the purpose of the
  question. For example, if there was a question that explicitly asked
  you to sort a list of numbers (something I would not ask since we
  haven't covered it), you would not be allowed to use the built in
  sort() method. If you have any questions about this, please ask
  during the exam.

* Overall instructions:

Create a single program named *anwers.py*. It should contain all the
functions specified below. When you run the program, it should
demonstrate that each function works by running them in order. It
should print a header before each function that looks as follows:

#+begin_example
------------------- Question 1 ----------------
some brief description of what the output should be
#+end_example

Followed by the output of your tests.

* 1

Write a function  *f(n,k)*
that will evaluate
[[file:/eqn1.png]]

* 2

Write a function *remove_e(sentence)* that
will take as a parameter a string representing a sentence. It will
return a new string with all ther occurances of the letter 'e'
removed.



* 3 

Write a function *box(length,height)* that will build a string consisting of
*height* lines. The odd lines will consist of *length* 'O's and the
even lines will consist of *length* 'X's. For example, *box(5,6)* will
return:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
OOOOO
XXXXX
OOOOO
XXXXX
OOOOO
#+END_SRC

For full credit, if height is an odd number, round it down to the
nearest even.



* 4 - makeacronym(w)

*** an acronym is an abreviation formed by taking the first letter of a
series of words. Some examples:

| Phrase                      | Acronym |
|-----------------------------+---------|
| Laugh Out Loud              | lol     |
| Read the... fine manual     | rtfm    |
| In my humble opinion        | imo     |
| In my not so humble opinion | imnsho  |

Write a function ~makeacronym(w)~ that takes
a string as a parameter and returns the acronym formed by taking the
first letter of each word and making a new string out of them. Assume
the input string is a sequence of words separated by spaces. Your
function should also convert all input to lower case.
